      If Contractor is required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests

      investigative demand or other similar legal process) to disclose any
      Confidential Information, and unless a court order or applicable law
      prevents it, Contractor will provide the Company with prompt notice of any
      such request or requirement so that the Company may seek a protective
      order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the
      provisions of this Agreement. If, in the absence of a protective order or
      other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the Company, Contractor is
      nonetheless legally compelled to disclose Confidential Information to any
      tribunal, regulatory authority, agency or similar entity, Contractor may
      disclose, without liability hereunder, only that portion of the
      Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed,
      provided that Contractor exercises best efforts, including cooperation
      with the Company, to preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential
      Information, and provided further that Contractor did not produce the
      legal compulsion to disclose by taking actions after the date of this
      Agreement that were not compelled by applicable law. Nothing in this
      Agreement prohibits Contractor from reporting possible violations of
      federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including
      the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
      Congress, and any agency inspector general, or making other disclosures
      that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of any applicable
      law or regulation. Contractor does not need the prior authorization of the
      Company to make any such reports or disclosures and Contractor is not
      required to notify the Company that Contractor has made such reports or
      disclosures.
